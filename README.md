# Ice caps melting
## *Jack keller*
Ice caps have been melting since the 1900's. its created a very bad impact on earth and the animals that live there.
climate change is also affecting how fast or slow the ice caps are melting due to the rising heat tempurature each year.
And if we are to fix that we need to slow down on using gas powerd cars and other tings and switch to electric things or solar power and also not use nuclear power plants and other dangerous and gas related factories.

 If we are to continue using gas for our cars and as a energy source, the world will overtime kill the animals and we are forced to move away from earth. but if we are able to change to elecrtc vehicles and energy, we ccould save the ice caps from melting and be able to live on earth longer.

if you got bored reading all the stuff I just wrote, switch to electric power and elctric cars to save the ice caps from melting.
