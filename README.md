# ice caps melting
## *jack keller*
Ice caps have been melting since the 1900's. its created a very bad impact on earth and the animals that live there.
climate change is also affecting how fast or slow the ice caps are melting due to the rising heat tempurature each year.
and if we are to fix that we need to slow down on using gas powerd cars and other tings and switch to electric things or solar power and also not use nuclear power plants and other dangerous and gas related factories.
